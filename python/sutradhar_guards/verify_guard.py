"""verify_guard - mechanise doctrine 2.2: a guard must be SHOWN to fail.

Doctrine 2.2 says: revert the fix, and the test must go red. A guard never
shown to fail is decoration. Until now that rule lived entirely on the
honour system - the one rule in this framework with the worst
consequence-to-enforcement ratio.

*Scar: a tenant-isolation fix shipped tested-and-half-dead for a week. Its
tests passed because they set internal state by hand instead of exercising
the real seam; the production path ran the guard in a thread whose context
write was discarded. Reverting the fix would not have reddened a single
test, and nobody ran that experiment.*

This tool runs that experiment mechanically:

  1. check out the fix commit in a throwaway worktree;
  2. run the guard there - it must be GREEN (if not, the premise is broken
     and we say so rather than reporting a result: doctrine 6.4);
  3. revert ONLY the production-code half of the commit, keeping the test
     half;
  4. run the guard again - it MUST go red. If it stays green, the guard is
     decoration and this exits nonzero.

The guard command is yours (`--guard-cmd "pytest tests/test_x.py::test_y"`,
`"go test ./billing/..."`, `"npx cypress run --spec ..."`), so the tool is
stack-agnostic; it only needs Python to run, not to verify.

    python verify_guard.py --guard-cmd "python -m pytest tests/test_tenant.py"
    python verify_guard.py --commit a1b2c3d --guard-cmd "npm test -- cart" \
        --link node_modules

Exit codes are a deliberate tri-state - "I could not tell" is never
reported as "pass":

    0  VERIFIED      the guard went red without the fix. It is real.
    1  DECORATION    the guard passed without the fix. It proves nothing.
    2  INCONCLUSIVE  premise broken, timeout, merge commit, bad usage.

Honest limits, stated plainly:

  - This mechanises the REVERT half of doctrine 2.2. The "weaken the seam,
    behavioural cases must go red" half is mutation testing and is not
    implemented here; `--guard-cmd` pointed at a behavioural suite plus a
    hand-weakened seam remains a manual exercise.
  - A guard can go red for the wrong reason (the revert breaks an import
    and nothing even loads). That is a weaker proof than a discriminating
    assertion, so it is reported as VERIFIED (weak) rather than silently
    counted as a clean pass.
  - Reverting is per-file, not per-hunk. A commit that mixes a fix and an
    unrelated change in one file reverts both; split your commits (or pass
    `--code` explicitly) if that matters.
