"""rounds - the flight recorder: make doctrine 8.1 and 8.3 computable.

Two rules in this framework ask a question nobody can currently answer.

**8.1** says a rule nobody can cite a save from is a candidate for deletion.
Answering that needs to know which rule caught what, over time. Nothing
recorded it, so no rule has ever been deleted for lack of evidence and the
doctrine can only grow.

**8.3** says stop when the marginal round yields less than the next cheapest
activity. *Scar: it took us 24 rounds to ask that question. Ask by round 5.*
Answering it needs findings-per-round. That was felt, not computed, which is
precisely why it took 24 rounds.

There is a third gap: the robustness-loop skill instructs you to keep a
"residual register" and ships no format for one.

This module reads round records - the artifact that skill already tells you
to write - and computes all three. It is a REPORTER first and a gate second:

    python rounds.py docs/rounds/            # the report
    python rounds.py docs/rounds/ --check    # gate: are the records valid?
    python rounds.py docs/rounds/ --floors . # add the mechanically-sampled half

## The round record

Prose first, because the record is a document a human writes and reads. The
machine only needs the table:

    # Round 7 - 2026-08-08

    Lenses: authz, numeric, scale

    | id | severity | rule | found-by | status | summary |
    |---|---|---|---|---|---|
    | R7-1 | high | 2.7 | swallow-lint | fixed | metering read swallowed to {} |
    | R7-2 | med  | 2.6 | scale lens   | deferred | sweep uncapped above 50k |
    | R6-3 | med  | 3.1 | -            | closed | picker effect asserted |

    ...then the prose the skill asks for: corrected premises, harness
    gotchas, what you ruled out.

`severity` is high/med/low, `status` is fixed/deferred/closed, and `rule` is
a doctrine id (`2.7`) or `-`. A deferred finding stays in the residual
register until a later round lists the same id as closed or fixed.

## Provenance, because this tool reports numbers (doctrine 5.1)

Findings are **recorded**: a human or agent typed them, and a logbook can be
wrong or lazy in ways telemetry cannot. Floors (`--floors`) are **measured**:
sampled from the baseline files themselves with nobody's judgement in the
loop. The report labels which is which, and never presents one as the other.

The honest limit that follows: this measures the loop, not the codebase. A
round that found nothing because nobody looked hard produces the same row as
a round that found nothing because there was nothing to find. The stop-rule
verdict is evidence for a decision, not the decision.
