"""Env-gated test tiers that audit their own skip gates.

The trap this module exists for: a pytest marker like ``requires_full_stack``
that auto-skips unless an env var is set is a fine pattern - until nothing
anywhere sets the var. Then the gated tests run in NO environment while the
suite reports green, and a skip marker nothing sets is indistinguishable
from a deleted test.

That happened to us: ~86 tests, including the entire billing arithmetic,
were discovered to have never executed anywhere. The conftest even claimed a
CI job set the variable; the claim was false and nothing checked it.

So this module gives you both halves:

1. ``register_env_gate`` - the standard auto-skip wiring for conftest.py.
2. ``audit_skip_gates`` - a test that FAILS unless every gating env var is
   actually set by something in your CI config. The gate audits itself.

conftest.py wiring:

    from sutradhar_guards.envgate import EnvGate, apply_env_gates

    GATES = [
        EnvGate(marker="requires_full_stack",
                env_var="FULL_STACK",
                reason="needs the full docker stack"),
    ]

    def pytest_configure(config):
        for g in GATES:
            config.addinivalue_line("markers", f"{g.marker}: {g.reason}")

    def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):
        apply_env_gates(GATES, items)

And the audit, as a normal test:

    def test_every_skip_gate_is_set_somewhere():
        audit_skip_gates(GATES, search_globs=[".github/workflows/*.yml",
                                              "Makefile", "docker-compose*.yml"])

    The check is textual on purpose: it asks "does this variable's name
    appear in any CI/automation file at all", which catches the deleted-job
    and renamed-variable failure modes with zero YAML parsing. A textual hit
    can still be a lie (a comment), so pair this with one real CI run where
    you confirm the gated tier's tests appear in the output count.
