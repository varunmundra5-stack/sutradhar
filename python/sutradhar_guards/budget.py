"""budget - mechanise doctrine 1.1: state your cardinalities before building.

Doctrine 1.1 is, by our own README's account, the cheapest rule in the
framework and the one whose absence cost us the most. Until now it shipped
as a markdown table nothing read.

*Scar: an unbounded fleet sweep worked perfectly at demo scale (50 entities)
and OOM-crashed the datastore at 200,000. The design-time sentence - "this
must survive 200,000 meters" - would have cost nothing to write. Finding out
instead cost a full scale pass and seventeen store crashes.*

The gate here is deliberately NOT "did you write a design note". That is
bureaucracy: it is guessable, gameable, and it measures paperwork. The gate
is the second, harder question:

    **Is every number you declared actually enforced by a test?**

A budget declared and never enforced is decoration - the same disease as a
guard that has never been shown to fail. So this module does two things.

**1. The test reads its N from the design note.**

    ---
    sutradhar_budget: fleet-sweep
    n: 200000
    p95_ms: 800
    memory_mb: 512
    ---

    def test_fleet_sweep_at_design_scale():
        with budget("fleet-sweep") as b:
            sweep(synth_meters(b.n))      # b.n IS the declared 200,000

Nobody hand-picks a comfortable N. Raising the design figure automatically
makes the test harder; lowering it is a visible diff in the design note,
which is exactly where that argument belongs.

**2. A declared budget with no test is a build failure.**

    python budget.py docs/design/ --tests tests/

Honest limits, stated plainly:

  - `memory_mb` is measured with `tracemalloc`, which counts PYTHON heap
    allocations, not process RSS. It will not see memory held by a C
    extension, the interpreter itself, or your database driver's buffers.
    It is a good proxy for "this data structure got too big" and a bad one
    for "the container OOMed"; the drill remains the authority on RSS.
  - The latency check is a CEILING on the runs you actually performed, not
    a percentile estimate. `p95_ms` records design intent; a single-sample
    run that exceeds it fails. Declare `ci_slack` for shared runners rather
    than quietly widening the number, so the looseness stays in the diff.
  - Enforcement is detected by finding the budget's id quoted in a test
    file. That is a text match: it proves a test MENTIONS the budget, not
    that the assertion is meaningful. Pair it with `verify_guard.py` on the
    commit that introduces the budget if you want the stronger claim.
