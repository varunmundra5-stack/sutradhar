 * Route sweep - the outer-loop baseline every app should have.

 * its fetches, and logged zero meaningful console errors.
 *
 * This one spec catches the page-crashes-on-mount class that code review
 * structurally cannot see (the crash is in the interaction between the
 * page, the router, and live data). It found real defects on day one in

 *
 * Copy into cypress/e2e/, adjust ROUTES and the login command, delete this
