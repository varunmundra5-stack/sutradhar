# Frontend playbook: the two loops

Frontend verification is two different loops with two different tools, and
most teams (and most agents) run neither properly. The failure mode this
playbook exists for: a session in which five UI defects were found by a
human clicking around and zero by the test suite - because the suite
asserted that things render, and every defect was in what things do.

## The inner loop: while building

**Assert on the running app's runtime state. Never eyeball pixels.**

While you are building a feature, your feedback loop is the running dev
server. The discipline:

- Verify against **network responses** (did the request fire, what came
  back), **store/state values** (did the selection persist), and the
  **console** (did anything throw) - through runtime observation: browser
  devtools protocol, MCP browser tooling, or a Reticle-class runtime
  assertion tool. This is where a tool like
  [Reticle](https://github.com/reticlehq/reticle) slots in, and any
  equivalent works.
- A screenshot that "looks right" proves nothing in either direction: the
  data can be hardcoded, the control can be dead, the store can be stale.
  Pixels lie both ways.
- The inner loop is fast and disposable. Its assertions do NOT need to be
  committed; they need to be *true right now*.

## The outer loop: the regression gate

**The committed e2e suite asserts behavior, not existence.**

The inner loop dies with the session. What protects the feature next month
is the committed suite, and it must assert the things that actually break:

1. **Route baseline** (breadth, cheap, first): every route x role renders,
   is not bounced by auth, shows no error boundary, settles all fetches,
   logs zero meaningful console errors. One spec, generated from the route
   table. See [js/cypress/routeSweep.example.cy.ts](../js/cypress/routeSweep.example.cy.ts).
2. **Effect assertions** (depth, opt-in per control): every interactive
   control asserts an EFFECT - URL, DOM, or persisted state changed
   (`expectEffect`). The control-that-does-nothing class ships constantly
   under render-only suites: a picker whose choice a context overwrote on
   the same tick, a "sort" header that was static text. Both rendered
   perfectly.
3. **Paint checks** (the outer loop's exclusive job): overprint and
   occlusion detection (`overprintsIn`). Runtime state can be correct while
   the pixels are wrong, so geometry assertions belong in the committed
   suite - and they must measure inked bounds via Range, because box
   geometry and scrollWidth are both blind to real overlap defects (we
   proved this against a reproduction, twice).

## Instrumentation is source work

- Give every new component stable testids AT BUILD TIME, one naming idiom
  per project. A surface shipped without anchors is unanchorable, and
  retrofitting ids costs more than a sprint of specs.
- Do not measure a suite by counting selectors. A testid can exist and be
  unreachable (component mounted on one page nobody visits); a spec can
  pass vacuously (`not.exist` against long-deleted UI, catch-all redirects
  masking dead routes). Measure REACHABILITY (the sweep actually landed on
  the route) and EFFECT (the interaction changed something).

## Waiting is measurement, not sleep

A fixed `wait(1200)` is a bet that the app is done; against a slow fetch it
silently asserts against the pre-crash frame. Count in-flight requests
(patch `fetch` before app code runs) and settle on zero, then a grace beat,
then re-check for follow-up fetches. The helper is `trackPendingRequests` +
`waitForIdle` in [js/cypress/uiGuards.ts](../js/cypress/uiGuards.ts).

## Console ignore lists have rules

Every ignored console pattern carries a comment saying why it is safe. An
ignore list without reasons only grows, and a guard whose ignore list has
swallowed it is decoration that still runs in CI.
