# Operations playbook

What code reading cannot find, and how to find it on purpose. The record
this distills: the un-restorable backup, the root-owned data directory, the
architecture-dependent build, and the half-dead-in-production fix were ALL
invisible to review and each fell out of the first drill or runtime check
that touched it.

## Drills, on a schedule

The four drills and their full protocol live in
[agent/skills/ops-drill.md](../agent/skills/ops-drill.md). The short form:

| Drill | Cadence | Non-negotiable |
|---|---|---|
| Cold-start install from docs alone | Before first deploy, then per release | Every stumble is a doc-fix commit the same day |
| Backup restore + reconciliation | Monthly, and before any real data | Counts diffed against source; "backup exists" proves nothing |
| Unattended soak | Before first unattended operation | Gaps in observation reported as gaps, never assumed continuous |
| Upgrade in place | Per upgrade path you claim to support | On a stack carrying data, gates green after |

## Exit-code discipline

The cheapest rule with the highest save rate:

- Never pipe a build or test through anything that swallows `$?`.
  `make build | tail -20` reports the tail of a FAILED build with tail's
  exit code. Capture `EXIT=$?` explicitly, print it, act on it.
- A truncated run reports as truncated. Exit 137 is a killed process; a
  killed test run shows its last green line and looks like a short pass.
  Compare counts against the expected total every time.
- Watch for flag interactions that eat your signal: a config-level `-q`
  plus a command-line `-q` can suppress the very summary line you are
  parsing.
- Measure, never eyeball: row counts, exit codes, RSS, computed layout. If
  the verification is "it looks fine", it is not verification.

## Verify the null

Before filing any finding, prove the test itself is valid:

- `docker kill` suppresses `restart: always` by design; a "container did
  not restart" finding from it is a bug in the drill, not the stack. Crash
  PID 1 inside the container instead.
- A test that fails for an environmental reason (missing mount, wrong env
  var) produces findings about your harness, not the system. Prove
  pre-existing vs regression by running the same check at the baseline
  commit.
- A false finding costs more trust than no finding, because the next real
  one gets discounted.

## Observability floor

Before anything runs unattended, four surfaces have metrics: requests
(count + latency by route template, not raw path - cardinality), jobs
(fired, succeeded, failed), ingest/throughput chokepoints, and dependency
up/down gauges. The gauge probes must not block the serving path.
A metrics endpoint that cannot load its client library degrades to an
honest comment block, never an empty 200 a scraper reads as "all zero".

## Shared-host hygiene

- Scrub selectively; never global-prune volumes on a machine that runs
  anything else. Verify the neighbors survived.
- Services with restart policies come back after a `stop` issued hours
  ago. Re-check what is actually running before attributing resource
  pressure.
- Two test runs sharing one backend poison each other's verdicts. If a
  failure looks impossible, check for a concurrent run before debugging.
